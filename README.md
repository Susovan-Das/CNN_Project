# CNN_Project

This project is about a Binary classification problem statement in which it has to classify the person in the images which are with mask and without mask.

Therefore i have build a Deep Learning CNN architecture which can predict by taking images as input.
This project includes fetching dataset from kaggle through API Key, then basic image procession and training the model through convolutional layers.
